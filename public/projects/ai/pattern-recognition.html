        <h2 id="content0-title" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">📖 Introduction</h2>
        <div id="content0-content" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">
          <p>The ability to recognize patterns is a critical skill that underpins many important tasks such as image processing, data analysis, and decision making. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), we have seen the potential for machines to excel at pattern recognition, given their exceptional ability to process vast amounts of data accurately and quickly. Despite the remarkable progress made in this field, it is not yet clear how AI&#39;s pattern recognition capabilities stack up against those of human beings.</p>
          <p>In this research project, I aim to compare the pattern recognition abilities of humans and AI, particularly those that have been trained using reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning involves training an AI system through trial-and-error accordingly giving rewards and punishments. </p>

        <h3 id="content1-title" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">❓ Hypothesis</h3>
        <div id="content1-content" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">
          <p>I predict that the AI&#39;s reinforcement learning approach will enable it to identify hidden patterns quicker and with more accuracy than human participants. Unlike a human brain, an AI does not rely on biases or sudden insights to identify the patterns and will instead depends on a neural network to make informed decisions.</p>

        <div id="content6-content" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">
          <p>Participants and AI are presented a task that involved grid patterns. The task required them to analyze a 3x3 grid of squares that had been randomly generated. Each square in the grid was either shaded black or left white.</p>
          <div class="image-single">
              <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Tq8QxxC/grids.png" alt="Grid Patterns" class="single-image">
          </div>
          <p>In this study, participants were presented with the challenge of identifying diagonals within the grid. The participants were required to respond with either Yes or No, indicating the presence or absence of the pattern, respectively. The task was intentionally designed to be demanding, as the participants had no prior knowledge of the pattern. Nevertheless, through repeated attempts and observations, the participants gradually acquired the ability to discern patterns that were more likely to elicit a Yes or No response.</p>
          <p>The AI was presented with an identical task as the human participants. The AI uses a neural network constructed out of nodes, designed to function similarly to neurons in the human brain. There are 9 input nodes, one for each square in the grid, and 1 output node, for either No or Yes. Groups of nodes are called layers and information would pass through each layer so that the AI could make a decision.</p>
          <p>The AI&#39;s code was designed to receive a randomized grid and output an answer based on the input configuration. The AI utilized a reinforcement learning technique, enabling it to optimize its decision-making abilities. Multiple copies of the AI could run simultaneously, significantly accelerating the learning process.</p>
          <p>These nodes are interconnected, and as the AI learned, the neural links evolved accordingly. The AI was programmed to receive positive reinforcement for correct responses and conversely, a punishment for incorrect responses.</p>

          <p>The vast majority of participants were able to identify the underlying pattern within the 3x3 grid. On average, participants took 13.82 minutes to complete the task, with an average time per configuration of approximately 4.05 seconds. Interestingly, there was significant variability in the time taken to complete the task, with participants ranging from 5 minutes to 29 minutes.</p>

          <p>The AI demonstrated a logarithmic progression, with an accuracy rate of 95% after 32 minutes and a 100% accuracy rate after 41 minutes. Unlike human participants, the AI lacked any biases or sudden insights and instead had to rely on its reinforcement learning technique to correctly identify the underlying pattern.</p>

        <h2 id="content10-title" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">🤔 Conclusion</h2>
        <div id="content10-content" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">
          <p>Overall, the results of this experiment suggest that both human participants and AI are capable of identifying complex patterns within a 3x3 grid configuration, albeit with varying degrees of accuracy and completion time. The participant results indicate that the task is challenging yet achievable, with a learning curve and significant variability in accuracy and completion time among participants. Meanwhile, the AI demonstrated a consistent pattern of logarithmic progression, highlighting the effectiveness of its reinforcement learning technique.</p>
          <p>It is clear that the AI outperformed human participants in terms of accuracy and completion time. However, it is important to note that the AI was specifically designed for this task and lacked the cognitive biases and limitations that humans possess. Despite this, the human participants were able to achieve a high level of accuracy and demonstrated a learning curve over time, suggesting that the task is not impossible for humans to perform.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, this experiment provides valuable insights into the pattern recognition abilities of both human participants and AI. While the AI outperformed humans in terms of accuracy and completion time, the human participants were still able to achieve a high level of accuracy and displayed a learning curve over time. Future research could focus on comparing the pattern recognition abilities of humans and AI in more complex tasks and exploring the potential for collaboration between humans and AI in these types of tasks.</p>

        <h3 id="content11-title" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">🧱 Limitations</h3>
        <div id="content11-content" style="transform: translateY(50px); opacity: 0; transition: all 0.1s ease-out;">
          <p>Several limitations to the experiment measuring the pattern recognition of humans and AI should be considered. Firstly, the sample size of human participants may not be sufficiently large to produce robust results, and could lead to selection bias as the participants are not representative of the larger population. Furthermore, the AI&#39;s amount of nodes were abitraryally chosen as it was most convientent at the time. The amount of nodes (nuerons) in the AI brain could have changed how the AI learns the data. Finally, confounding variables, such as participant fatigue or external distractions, could have a negative impact on the reliability of the results. It is critical to carefully consider these potential limitations when interpreting the outcomes of the experiment, and to draw only appropriate conclusions.</p>
